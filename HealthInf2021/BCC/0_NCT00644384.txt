brief_title: Acitretin in Preventing Skin Cancer in Patients at High Risk for Skin Cancer
official_title: Chemoprevention Trial of Acitretin Versus Placebo in Patients at High Risk for Basal Cell Carcinoma Sense3 or Squamous Cell Carcinoma
brief_summary:
 RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of acitretin may stop cancer from growing in patients at high risk for basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. PURPOSE: This randomized trial is studying how well acitretin works in preventing skin cancer in patients at high risk for skin cancer.
