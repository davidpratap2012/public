 Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Basal Cell Skin Cancer
Official_title:
 A Phase I Study Of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) For The Treatment Of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) Sense3: A Drug/Light Dose Finding Study Utilizing 2-(1-HEXYLOXYETHYL)-2-DEVINYL PYROPHEOPHORBIDE-A (HPPH-PHOTOCLOR)
Brief_summary:
 RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses light and drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to
      light to kill tumor cells. Photosensitizing drugs such as HPPH are absorbed by cancer cells
      and, when exposed to light, become active and kill the cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy with HPPH in
      treating patients who have basal cell skin cancer.
