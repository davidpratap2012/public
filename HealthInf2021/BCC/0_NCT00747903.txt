brief_title: Photodynamic Therapy Using Aminolevulinic Acid in Treating Patients With Skin Cancer
official_title: Investigation of the Effectiveness of Non-Coherent Blue Light in Intralesional Photodynamic of Basal Cell Carcinoma Nothing selected
brief_summary:
 RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug that becomes active when it is exposed to  certain kind of light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed. This may be an effective treatment against skin cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of photodynamic therapy using aminolevulinic acid and to see how well it works in treating patients with skin cancer.
