 Imiquimod Cream in Treating Patients With Basal Cell Skin Cancer
official_title:
 Double-Blind, Vehicle-Controlled Study to Evaluate Apoptosis in Basal Cell Carcinoma Sense3 Treated With Aldara™ (Imiquimod) Cream, 5% Applied Once or Twice a Day
brief_summary:
 RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as imiquimod cream, work in different ways to stimulate
      the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying how well imiquimod cream works in treating
      patients with basal cell skin cancer.
