 A Pilot Study of the Treatment of Facial Nodular and Nodulocystic Basal Cell Carcinoma With Double Curettage and Cautery Followed by Application of Imiquimod to the Base
brief_summary:
 The purpose of this study is to determine recurrence rates of nodular Basal Cell Carcinomason the face removed with curettage and electrodessication (cautery) followed by application of Imiquimod cream to the base and further to achieve lower recurrence rates than after treatment with curettage and electrodessication alone.
