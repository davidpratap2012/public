Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)
official_title:
 The Importance of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) as a New Indicators of Myocardial Ischemic Injury in Comparison With Commonly Used Biomarkers.
brief_summary:
 The main aim of the study is a comparison of serum and plasma concentration of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor), HGF (Hepatocyte Growth Factor) and PDGF (Platelet Derived Growth Factor) with markers of myocardial injury as troponin I, hsCRP, CK-MB and NT-proBNP assessed in patients with first episode of acute coronary syndrome (ACS Sense6) in their lives and the estimation of assumed value of VEGF, HGF and PDGF in prognosis of cardiovascular complications at 3 months follow up especially with respect to myocardial infarction (MI), exacerbation of angina, reintervention (PTCA,CABG), symptoms of heart failure, stroke, rehospitalization due to cardiovascular reasons and death. The dynamics of changes in serum and plasma concentration of growth factors in comparison with values of myocardial injury markers will be checked. For the realization of the purpose of the study biochemical measurements will be performed twice i.e. just after admission to hospital and 24h later.  Area of a myocardial injury will be estimated by echocardiography examination.
inclusion_criteria:
