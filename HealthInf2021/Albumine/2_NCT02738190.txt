brief_summary:
 This is a randomized controlled trial that compares two different priming composition (albumin vs. fresh frozen plasma) for extracorporeal circulation of pediatric patients under 10 kg of weight.

This study is aimed to test the hypothesis that Albumin is superior to fresh frozen plasma in terms of minor bleeding and transfusional requirements.
