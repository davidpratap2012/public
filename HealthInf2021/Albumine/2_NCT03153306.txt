brief_title: Importance of the Infusion Rate for the Plasma Expanding Effect of 5% Albumin Meaning not listed in the Septic Patient
official_title: None
brief_summary:
 Correction of hypovolemia is an important therapeutic measureï¼ŒEven though there is no consensus regarding infusion rates, a plasma volume (PV) expander is often given at a fast rate to treat a suspected hypovolemia without delay which can be associated with aggravation of adverse interstitial accumulation of macromolecules and fluid, especially in inflammatory conditions such as sepsis.the smallest possible volumes for PV resuscitation to maintain normovolemia should be used to reduce the risk of simultaneous interstitial fluid accumulation. The investigators tested the hypothesis that a slow infusion rate of a PV expander results in better plasma expansion than a fast infusion rate to patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.
