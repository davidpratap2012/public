official_title: Volume Kinetics for 20% Albumin in Conscious and Anesthetized Humans With and Without Inflammation
brief_summary:
 The study aims to determine the degree of plasma volume expansion and the half-life of the plasma volume expansion when 3 mL/kg of hyperoncotic (20%) albumin if infused over 30 minutes in conscious healthy volunteers, in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia, and on the day after major surgery when the patient is in a post surgical inflammatory state. The  study also examines the increase in the plasma colloid osmotic pressure as a result of this infusion and its possible influence on markers of kidney damage.
inclusion_criteria:
 - Healthy volunteers. - Patients in ASA classes I-II scheduled for surgery.
exclusion_criteria:
 - Expected major hemorrhage during surgery. - Blood hemoglobin concentration of < 10 g/dL.
