official_title: Fresh Frozen Plasma as a Substitute for Albumin in Patients Receiving a Large Volume Paracentesis
brief_summary:
 Large volume paracentesis with albumin administration is the standard of care for patients with refractory ascites complicating end-stage liver disease. However, the use of albumin is frequently limited due to expense and occasional short supply. The goal of this study is to demonstrate if the administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is as effective as albumin for volume expansion at the time of a large volume paracentesis.
