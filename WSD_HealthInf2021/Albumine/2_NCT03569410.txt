official_title: The Effect of Natural Protein vs. Protein Supplements on Peritoneal Dialysis Patients An Open-label Prospective Clinical Trial
brief_summary:
This study is a prospective open label clinical trial comparing serum albumin Sense1  levels and total protein intake in the peritoneal dialysis patient population. A total of 60 patients were enrolled, 16 chose to be in the natural food group and 44 in the supplement group. 4 were lost to follow-up in the supplement group leading to an n of 40. Both groups were educated by dietitians on how to increase their protein intake to a goal of 1.4g/kg/day. The groups were followed for 3 months with protein intake calculated according to the patient's food diaries. Patient demographics and characteristics were compared in both groups.
