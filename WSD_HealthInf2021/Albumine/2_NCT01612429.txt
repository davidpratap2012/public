official_title: Amino Acid Therapy to Modify Protein Carbamylation in End Stage Renal Disease
brief_summary:
 This is a pilot study to evaluate the effects of amino acid supplementation on the structure of certain proteins in the blood of dialysis patients. Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) usually have high levels of urea that may interact with blood proteins and change their structure by a process known as carbamylation. The investigators are interested in determining whether carbamylation is linked to adverse outcomes in dialysis patients and have hypothesized that supplementation with a balanced formulation of amino acids can reduce the amount of carbamylation that occurs. In this study, dialysis patients (n= up to 30) will receive intravenous supplementation with an FDA-approved amino acid solution (NephrAmine®, 5.4% amino acids) during regular dialysis sessions (3 times weekly for 6 weeks). During the 6 weeks of therapy and for 2 weeks of follow-up, blood will be drawn from patients' existing hemodialysis access ports (~60 ml total per month) to measure levels of carbamylated albumin Sense2, amino acids, and standard laboratory values. Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability of the amino acid therapy. For each treated subject, we will follow an additional individual that is not receiving treatment to serve as a control (no intervention).

exclusion_criteria:
 - Taking any type of amino acid supplementation within the last 90 days - Received parenteral nutrition within last 90 days - History of allergy to any amino acid compound - Poorly controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg during any of the previous 3 dialysis sessions (confirmed by repeat) - Severe hepatic impairment - Condition with prognosis <1 year at time of study entry - Current active treatment in another investigational study or participation in another investigational study in the 1 month prior to screening - Active malignancies or other serious concurrent or recent medical or psychiatric condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the patient unsuitable for participation in this study
