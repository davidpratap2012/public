official_title:  Amino Acid Therapy to Modify Protein Carbamylation in End Stage Renal Disease: A Randomized Trial
brief_summary:
 Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) usually have high levels of urea that may interact with blood proteins and change their structure by a process known as carbamylation. Evidence suggests that high levels of carbamylated proteins may be linked to adverse outcomes in dialysis patients. This is a randomized, open-label study to evaluate the effects of amino acid supplementation on levels of carbamylated proteins in ESRD patients. Secondary objectives will be to determine whether this intervention can modify intermediate markers of inflammation, cardiac stress, and erythropoietin responsiveness in this population. Sixty ESRD patients on dialysis will be randomized into two groups of 30 patients each. Group 1 will receive intravenous supplementation with an FDA-approved amino acid solution (250 mL of NephrAmine®, 5.4% amino acids) during regular dialysis sessions (3 times weekly for 8 weeks); Group 2 will be treated according to standard-of-care (no amino acid supplementation). During the 8 weeks of therapy and for 4 weeks of follow-up, blood will be drawn from patients' existing hemodialysis access ports (~20 mL once per month) to measure levels of carbamylated albumin Sense1, amino acids, selected biomarkers, and standard laboratory values. Patients randomized to Group 1 will have fluid volume equivalent to the amino acid therapy removed by ultra-filtration to avoid net fluid gain. All patients will be monitored for safety (adverse events) and for changes in hemodynamics and dialysis prescription.
