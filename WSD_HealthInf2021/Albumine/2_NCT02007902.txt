official_title: Early Plasma Protein Levels and Neonatal Hemodynamics: a Prospective Evaluation in Very Preterm Infants
brief_summary:
 The primary aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between early plasma protein levels and hemodynamics in very preterm infants during postnatal transition. Secondary aims are the following: i) to evaluate maternal and neonatal factors affecting plasma protein level at birth; ii) to evaluate the relationship between plasma protein level and albumin Sense1 level on the first day of life; iii) to evaluate the association between early hypoproteinemia and neonatal mortality and morbidity in very preterm infants.
inclusion_criteria:
 - Parents written informed consent - Birth at less than 32 weeks of gestational age - Birth in a III level delivery facility at Reunion Island
exclusion_criteria:
 - Major congenital abnormalities
