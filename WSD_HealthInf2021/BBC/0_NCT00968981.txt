official_title: A Phase Ib, Open-Label, Dose-Scheduling Study of Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitor GDC-0449 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors That Are Refractory to Standard Therapy or for Whom No Standard Therapy Exists
brief_summary:
This is a two stage, Phase Ib study designed to describe the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0449 in patients with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to treatment or for whom no standard therapy exists.
inclusion_criteria:
 - Histologically documented, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancy that has progressed after first-line and second-line therapy (if there is a second-line therapy that has been shown to provide clinical benefit); patients with basal cell carcinoma  Sense3 will be excluded from this study unless they do not qualify for another open GDC-0449 clinical trial - For patients with disease that is evaluable by physical examination only, diagnosis must also include biomarker confirmation - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 - Documented negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential and agreement to use an effective form of contraception for the duration of the study - Adequate hematopoietic capacity - Adequate hepatic function - Adequate renal function - At least 3 weeks since last chemotherapy, investigational agent, radiation therapy, or major surgical procedure and recovery to pre-treatment baseline or stabilization of all treatment-related toxicities
exclusion_criteria:
 - Known, untreated central nervous system (CNS) malignancies or treated brain metastases that are not radiographically stable for â‰¥ 3 months - Active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics - Clinically significant history of liver disease, including cirrhosis, current alcohol abuse, or current known active infection with hepatitis - Any medical condition or diagnosis that would likely impair absorption of an orally administered drug (e.g., gastrectomy, ileal bypass, chronic diarrhea, gastroparesis) - Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or renders the patient at high risk from treatment complications - Pregnant or lactating - Treatment with excluded medications, including strong CYP450 inhibitors and inducers
