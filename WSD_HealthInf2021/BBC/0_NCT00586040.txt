official_title:  Photochemical Tissue Bonding (PTB) for Excisional Wound Healing
brief_summary:
The broad aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) for the closure of skin excisions. We will test the hypothesis that full thickness skin excisions treated with PTB can heal with less scarring than those treated with the conventional suture closure method.
