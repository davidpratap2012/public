official_title:  Serum Concentration of Lidocaine After Local Injection During Mohs Micrographic Surgery
brief_summary:
 The primary objective of this study is to (1) determine whether local injection of lidocaine
 used during Mohs surgery will elevate serum lidocaine concentrations to a level that could
 cause systemic symptoms and (2) determine whether sustained high levels of serum lidocaine occur after intralesional anesthesia on the face and neck. This study is a cross-sectional study of 10 subjects with basal cell carcinoma  Sense3or squamous cell carcinoma of the face or neck
requiring Mohs micrographic surgery. The study will consist of a brief questionnaire and blood draws during their Moh's surgical procedure.
inclusion_criteria:
 - Age: 18-75 - Basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the head or neck - Subjects are in good health - Subjects that have the willingness and the ability to understand and provide informed consent for the use of their blood and communicate with the investigator
exclusion_criteria:
 - Lidocaine sensitivity - Bleeding disorder - Pregnancy - Medical conditions which would impair hepatic blood flow: congestive heart failure, liver dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease. - Subjects who are unable to understand the protocol or to give informed consent - Subjects with mental illness
