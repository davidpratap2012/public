 Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Skin Cancer
Official_title:
 Cutaneous Absorption and Intralesional Penetration of Topical Amino-Levulinic Acid in Basal Cell Carcinoma Sense3 and Squamous Cell Carcinoma as Measured by In Situ Fluorescence and Intensified Video Fluorescence Microscopy
Brief_summary:
 RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses light and drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to
      light to kill tumor cells. Photodynamic therapy using aminolevulinic acid cream may be
      effective in treating patients with skin cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well photodynamic therapy works in
      treating patients with skin cancer.
