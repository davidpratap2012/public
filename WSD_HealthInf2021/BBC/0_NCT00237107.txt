brief_title: Debulking Effect of Curretage on Basal Cell Carcinomas  Sense3 - a Histological Assessment.
official_title:  Relation of Basal Cell Carcinoma Tumour Thickness, Histologically Estimated, in Punch Biopsies Performed Before and After Curretage.
brief_summary:
 The aim of this study was to compare histologically observed tumour infitration of basal cellcarcinoma (bcc) lesions before and after curretage.A significant reduction of tumour depth would enable further bcc's included for superficial non-invasive treatment modalities such as topical photodynamic therapy.
inclusion_criteria:
 - bcc with tumour depth two mm.or more
exclusion_criteria:
 - bcc tumours smaller than three mm in mean diameter.
