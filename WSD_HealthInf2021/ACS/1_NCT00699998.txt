official_title: A Comparison of Prasugrel and Clopidogrel in Acute Coronary Syndrome Subjects With Unstable Angina/Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Who Are Medically Managed
brief_summary:
 This study will evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of prasugrel and clopidogrel in a medically managed Unstable Angina/Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI) acute coronary syndrome (ACS) Sense6 population (that is, patients who are not managed with acute coronary revascularization).
inclusion_criteria:
 - Have had a Unstable Angina/Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI) index event within 10 days prior to randomization - Had a medical management strategy decision made with reasonable certainty that neither percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) nor coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is planned for treatment of the index event - Had at least 1 of 4 specified high-risk features at the time of the UA/NSTEMI event Key
exclusion_criteria:
 - Decision for medical management greater than 72 hours after onset of index event without commercial clopidogrel treatment within 72 hours following onset of the index event. - Insignificant coronary artery disease (CAD) on coronary angiography if performed for Index Event (absence of greater than or equal to 30% stenosis in at least one native vessel) - Previous or planned PCI or CABG as treatment for the index event - PCI/CABG within previous 30 days - ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as the index event - Cardiogenic shock, Refractory ventricular arrhythmias, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV congestive heart failure (CHF) within the previous 24 hours - History of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), Intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm - History of spontaneous gastrointestinal (GI) or non-GI bleeding requiring hospitalization for treatment, unless definitive treatment has occurred and there is low likelihood of recurrence - Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis
