official_title:  A Prospective, Randomized, Verum Controlled, Open Label, Parallel Group Multi-center Phase III Clinical Trial to Demonstrate the Superiority of 500 or 250 mg Aspirin® i.v. (BAY 81-8781) Treatment Versus 300 mg Aspirin® N Tablets p.o. (BAY e4465A) in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome, Measured by Time Dependent Thromboxane Inhibition
brief_summary:
 The objective of this study is to investigate whether intravenous administration (injected into a vein) of acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) in doses of 250 and 500 mg is superior to oral treatment of ACS with tablets containing 300 mg of Aspirin.
inclusion_criteria:
 - Angina pectoris lasting for more than 20 minutes within the last 24 hours before study drug treatment (or equivalent acute symptoms such as increasing dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, abdominal/epigastric pain, syncope etc.) - ECG change suggestive for ischemia: - ST elevation or T-wave change or ST depression, new or presumed left bundle-branch block (LBBB) - Elevated troponin T level > 0.01 ng/ml, levels according to local laboratory reference values - Risk factors for ACS such as known coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus, impaired renal function, peripheral artery or cerebrovascular disease, current smoking.
exclusion_criteria:
 - Treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) within 48 hours prior to study drug treatment - Treatment with glycoprotein IIa/IIIb inhibitors within 48 hours prior to study drug treatment and before the 20 minutes blood samples for thromboxane, prostacycline and platelet aggregation measurement have been taken - Thrombolytic therapy within 24 hours before study drug treatment - Obligation for tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation - Contraindications to ASA treatment - Known haemorrhagic diathesis - Evidence of an active gastrointestinal or urogenital bleeding - Stroke within 3 months prior to study drug treatment - Major surgery including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) within 6 weeks prior to study drug treatment - Known severe hepatic or renal insufficiency - Pregnant or breast-feeding women
