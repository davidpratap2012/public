official_title:  Bedside Genetic Approach to Identify Clopidogrel CYP2C19 Metabolizer and Optimize Maintenance Thienopyridine Treatment After an Acute Coronary Syndrome: The GAMMA Study
brief_summary:
 To demonstrate that a strategy of fast genetic testing performed in outpatient clinic allows to select adequately one of the 2 antiplatelet treatments approved in the same indication (ACS Sense6 with PCI - prasugrel 10mg MD or clopidogrel 75mg MD). Patients will reach similar levels of platelet inhibition with the 2 different thienopyridines suggesting optimal risk/benefit ratio in most patients with individualized therapy.
inclusion_criteria:
 - ACS patients who underwent Percutaneous coronary intervention
exclusion_criteria:
 - Anemia <10g/dL - Indication for VKA - Recent bleeding or planned surgery - Thrombopenia <80 000/Âµl
