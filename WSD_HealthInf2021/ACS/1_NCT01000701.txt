official_title:  Inflammation and Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Sense6 - Novel Strategies for Prevention and Clinical Management
brief_summary:
 Subproject 1: Optimize prevention after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) by improving caregiver and patient education (http://elips.hug-ge.ch/eng/index_eng2.htm) Subproject 2: Discover novel genomic biomarkers of ACS in leukocyte subsets by means of analyzing gene expression profiles and function. Subproject 3: Evaluate novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in soluble form in blood/plasma and urine. Subproject 5: Visualize the vulnerable plaque using intravascular ultrasound/optical coherence tomography (IVUS/OCT) and correlate with outcome and biomarkers. Subproject 7: Characterize the effects of inflammation on progenitor/stem cell-mediated repair after ACS by means of analyzing gene expression profiles and function
inclusion_criteria:
 - All patients with age ≥ 18 years presenting within 5 days (preferably within 72 hours) after pain onset with the main diagnosis of ACS (acute myocardial infarction: STEMI /NSTEMI and threatened infarction: unstable angina pectoris), who enter the hospital: The patients show symptoms, which are compatible with angina pectoris (chest pain, dyspnoea) and at least one of the following characteristics: - persistent ST-segment elevation or depression, T inversion or dynamic ECG changes, new left bundle branch block (LBBB) - Evidence of positive troponin by local laboratory reference values with a rise and/or fall in serial troponin levels - known coronary artery disease, specified as status after myocardial infarction, CABG, or PCI or newly documented ≥50% stenosis of an epicardial coronary artery during the initial catheterization
exclusion_criteria:
 - Severe physical disability, - Dementia (inability to comprehend study), OR - Less than 1 year of life expectancy (for non-cardiac reasons).
